# Keydrown for MP

## A JavaScript key state handler for RPG Maker 2003MP
[Fork source repo](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/keydrown)  
Intend to ease making key config system on RPG Maker 2003 MP (and quick js on it)  
Inevitably this fork kills capability for running on browsers and etc.  
You may consider this somekind of degeneration of the original Keydrown. ogre  
**CURRENTLY DOES NOT WORK AT ALL, need some works to plug 2003MP actually**
